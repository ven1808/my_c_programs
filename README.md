# my_c_programs
This repository features a collection of my C programs, centered around basic problem-solving. As part of my daily coding routine, I am using these exercises to build a strong foundation in the C language while preparing for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This is an ongoing learning journey aimed at developing both my programming skills and problem-solving ability.
